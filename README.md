# question_answering_python

Question answering system is powered by the search engine results of the users question, when a user asks a question it utilizes search engine results to find answers to users questions using pattern matching and other techniques. In this project we used Wikipedia as search engine, and used predefined patterns to answer "Who" "What", "When", and "Where" questions.
